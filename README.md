DATA-BASED LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRACTION BEHAVIOR OF REMOTE WORKERS ACCORDING TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSD

This repostery is created by Umut Deniz Kaya.

The term "Remote Working," which entered every aspect of our lives with Covid-19 and the Pandemic, has become popular. This working model, which software developers have preferred for a long time, has become a choice familiar to many office workers and even students in business life. With entry of this working model into our private lives, we had to work with our discipline, and environmental factors began to affect our work performance in our private areas outside of factories and offices.

Based on this problem, I decided to examinate the effect of environmental factors on distraction. First, I designed a 4-step analysis and feedback system to define the process. I decided that these steps would be "Collecting Environmental Data" "Working Status Analysis" "Correlation of Data with Machine Learning" and "Feedback System" respectively.

First, I started measuring and recording the environmental factors that I could detect with the computer hardware that every remote worker usually uses. At the same time, I added a working condition algorithm and collected the data of these people when they were in front of the keyboard, mouse and screen. I analyzed the correlation between the operating status data I obtained and environmental factors using Random Tree Classifier and sent it to the user as feedback.

With my results, I increased the adequate working time during the day by creating ideal individual working values and using the feedback system.
